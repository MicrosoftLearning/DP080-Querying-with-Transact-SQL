# Lab: Use built-in functions in Transact-SQL
 
In this exercise, you will use Azure Data Studio to connect to the _MyStore_ database and execute some queries using built-in functions.

## Connect to the lab environment

When the VM lab environment opens, select the  **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** button in the **Resources** tab to open the login screen. 
Select the password on the **Resources** tab for the **Administrator** account to populate the password field, and then select the arrow to sign in to Windows.

## Open Azure Data Studio

There is an icon in the toolbar to open Azure Data Studio.

Select the icon for Azure Data Studio. The tool will open to a Welcome screen. If you get a message in the lower right corner asking if you want to enable **Preview features**, you can select either option. 

From the **File** menu, select **New Query**. You should now see a blank query window. 

## Use scalar functions

The queries will use a sample database called _MyStore_. Although there are about a dozen user tables in this database, we’ll only be working with a couple of them in this exercise. We’ll be using the _Orders_, _OrderDetails_ and _Customers_ tables. 

For the queries we are using, you can try typing them in directly or you can select File/Open File, and navigate to D:\Lab Code\Scalar functions. Double-click on the file script6.sql and it will be loaded into a new query window.

Remember that you can run an entire script at once, which will be multiple queries in this case. Or you can highlight a single query and select the **Run** button to execute just the highlighted query. 

Write a SELECT statement to retrieve the _contactname_, _phone_ and _fax_ information from the _Sales.Customers_ table.N If there is a missing value in the fax column, return the value “No information”.

Write two solutions, one using the COALESCE function and the other using the ISNULL function.
